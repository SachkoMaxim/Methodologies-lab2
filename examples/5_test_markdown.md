(**Do not take the text of this file seriously**)

This **file** is for your testing. There can be _an error_, or no `ERROR`
    at all. Just test it.
        And you'll      
know,   is  _there are some issues_,    or **not at all**.
Good luck `for you, stranger`. **Have**-**a**-_nice_-`day` 
.

Testing **This TYPE. 5 Tests. Sunny day/**
good _sunny day 5_.

_ - good. Very_good.

`**` - what is this O_O?    

```day

day 2

day 3```

_`_ - must be good?

And, of course, we need to test preformated text. Here it`is:


```
Today is a good day.
    Summer.     A      good     mood    .
  We'll have a **big cake   today.

Day 1   

    **He-He. He He**. _He_  `He`
`He`    
`_He_` . He`. `He

**He**



```


Another test:
```
    Small

test.
That`s      all.
```


The END.
